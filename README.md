Project includes Face Recognition and Storing the database required for Data modeling-


(1) store_data.py needs to be run to store data which will be required for modeling data. (40 photos will be clicked and stored in "imagesave" Folder and create a file named "data.csv" with the name entered.)

(2) Run building_model.py to build your model(a file named "project_model.h5" is created after model is completed)

(3) Now initial.py can be run to identify the face (By pressing 'c' keyword , a photo will be clicked and recognised with the help of saved model).
